# Location_v3


This Android app requires Google Play Services 8.4.0 and Android 7.23.1.1. 

This app uses a single activity to launch fine-grained location services using the Google Play location API, and stores the current location
along with date and time in the app's memory. The location is updated every 4 seconds. The service runs until destroyed by pressing a 
stop button. Accumulated location data may be viewed by pressing the "Locs" button.
